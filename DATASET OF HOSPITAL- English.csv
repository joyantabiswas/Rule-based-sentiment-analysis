The only good thing about this place is that the treatment is the best with the lowest costs available in Rajshahi . Therefore numerous patients comes here from different places every day.Admitting one of your sick dear family member is one of the challenging task here admists hundreds of people who also wants to be admitted. The process is very slow and it might take the whole day if you don't know anyone who works in the hospital premises or any relative who is a government officer. With no better bathroom facilities for the sick people. Hygiene is one the biggest problem here - the blame goes both to the public and staff members who are in charge of cleaning.

I've never visited the place before June 2021 though I lived in that area for 11 years. Anyways I went there for my son's circumcision purpose and surprisingly the doctors served their best and I'm really thankful to them.
I found no dalal or nuisance elements there rather the hospital area was really cool and calm.
The main obstacle that suffered me lot that is communication. From Babubazar Bridge, the road is very narrow and filthy. Rickshaw, CNG car or private car is not so available. Even in hospital area there’s only one pharmacy and if anybody failed to found any medicine there then you’ve to suffer a lot......Laaz Pharma or Tamanna Medicine type pharmacy is very urgent in that area.
Though I've visited the place for a particular purpose and the doctor was my relative, i have little opportunity to observe the whole scenario. This review may led you to angry with me for some reasons but I can say that I'm wholly satisfied with their service.",Sir Salimullah Medical College,"https://www.google.com/maps/@22.3591136,91.8415966,15z"
